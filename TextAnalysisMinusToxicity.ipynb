That\\'s why, Alex Telles will flop there. I guess you don\\'t know what Premier league is because you\\'re too busy watching Porto vs Farense.\\n\\n&gt;I didn\\'t. You\\'re either a bad troll or a complete moron. Learn to read.\\n\\nWhy? Because I exposed your bullshit with numbers from transfermarkt. Let me tell you moron, 17 times is greater than 3 times.
